We tried to swim across during the low tide to reach the other side to jump off a cliff. While swimming my roommate got swept away and as the current carried his body away I grabbed him. Holding him by his wrist while I am holding onto a boulder for my life until the tide slowed down. One of the scariest moments of my life. But eventually we made it across and jumped off a cliff!', likes: 0 },
